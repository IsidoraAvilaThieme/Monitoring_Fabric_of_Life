This file contains the script and data used to produce the network graph. All necessary resources
are included in this folder for convenience. To reproduce the original graph, you may run 
./figure_network.R after changing the R working directory to the one this file is into. 

Minor manual, cosmetic edits have been done to the generated figure for publication (added 
an arrow/text between the two Lessonia species, and fixed a label).
